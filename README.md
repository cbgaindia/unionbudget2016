# Union Budget 2016-17 Analysis Tool

[Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability (CBGA)](http://www.cbgaindia.org/) carries out an in depth analysis of the Union Budget and brings out a publication within 24 hours of the presentation of the Budget in Parliament every year. The main purpose of this Budget Analysis Tool is to facilitate an informed discussion on the Union Budget, particularly around the sectors and issues relevant for the poor and vulnerable sections of the population.

It presents a comprehensive analysis of the priorities and proposals in Union Budget 2016-17, focusing on social sectors (such as education, health, drinking water and sanitation, food security etc.) and the responsiveness of the Budget towards the vulnerable sections of the population (such as women, children, dalits, adivasis, religious minorities and urban poor). It also looks closely at the progressivity in the taxation policies adopted in the latest Budget.

We would be glad to get your feedback and suggestions as well as queries for additional information (at info@cbgaindia.org), which would help us improve our efforts in future.
