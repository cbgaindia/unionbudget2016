Jan Aushadhi Programme,,Rs crore,simple_bar,1.7,15.2,,16.9,35,,,,,,"The Jan Aushadhi scheme, introduced in 2008, has not really taken off as there are 164 Jan Aushadhi stores that have opened under the scheme, out of which only 87 are functional (according to Jan Aushadhi website http://janaushadhi.gov.in/faq.). The allocations for the scheme have increased only marginally in 2016-17 (BE) over 2015-16 (RE). The announcement of 3000 Jan Aushadhi centres is a welcome step but some of the main problems plaguing the scheme, viz. doctors not prescribing generic medicines to the patients and the non-availability of medicines under their generic names, still need to be tackled.","The Jan Aushadhi scheme is under the Department of Pharmaceuticals, Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilisers"
