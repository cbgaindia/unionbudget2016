Allocations for Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation,,Rs crore ,simple_bar,12969,11935,12091,,10907,14010,"Budget 2016-17 has shown that the priority for sanitation especially rural sanitation has risen even more than in 2015-2016 (RE) clearly showing the government’s political will towards Swachh Bharat. Has increased allocation in sanitation come at the cost of decreased allocations for water? The NRDWP has shown a gradual decline since 2012-13 till 2016-17. (Table 7.1). The issue of water quality and sustainability persists in rural water.  With many states in the country reeling under a drought crisis, the allocation for rural water could have seen higher allocations."

Swachh Bharat Mission (Rural) / Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan,,,,2474,2244,2750,3502,6525,9000,"The total allocation for the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (R+U) is Rs. 11,300 (BE) with SBM ® at Rs. 9,000 crores and SBM (U) at Rs. 2,300 crores in 2016-2017 (BE). This is a significant jump from 2015-16 wherein the overall allocation for sanitation was Rs. 7,525 crores (RE)"
Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban),,,,0,0,0,0,1000,2300,"In SBM (U), the unit cost of constructing a toilet is Rs. 4,000 which a lot of states feel is less and hence, have supplemented the amount through their own resources. Evidences show that toilets are being constructed usually in areas which already have existing water supply connections. This leaves out a large section of the population who live in unauthorized colonies. Toilet construction amounts to a large part of the expenditures accounted in SBM. This should also simultaneously lead to increased usage and behavior change. Sustainability of toilets and slip-back in sanitation behavior needs to be looked into."
